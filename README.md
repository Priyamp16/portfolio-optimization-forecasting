# portfolio-optimization-forecasting
This project focuses on portfolio optimization using Mean-Variance, Black-Litterman models, Monte Carlo simulations, and ARIMA/LSTM forecasting to enhance investment strategies. Implemented in Python &amp; Quarto, it improved risk-adjusted returns by 15% over benchmark performance.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores portfolio optimization and return forecasting using financial models. It applies Mean-Variance Optimization, Black-Litterman Model, Monte Carlo Simulations, and Risk Parity to optimize asset allocation. Additionally, ARIMA and LSTM models are used for stock return forecasting.

ðŸ“Š Key Results
Mean-Variance Optimization: Sharpe Ratio 0.578, Expected Return 15.3%
Black-Litterman Model: Expected Return 10.71%, Volatility 27.26%
Monte Carlo Simulation: Best Sharpe Ratio 0.92, Expected Return 28.20%
Risk Parity Portfolio: Balanced allocation with Sharpe Ratio of 0.63
Grey Wolf vs. Particle Swarm Optimization: Grey Wolf achieved higher Sharpe (1.05) & return (25%)
ARIMA & LSTM Forecasting: Predicts future stock returns based on historical trends
